# amazonspring
Example using Spring with Hibernate, Spring security, Maven, Spring MVC and MYSQL, JSP and JSTL. The front end user interface is intentionally minimal without CSS for more clarity in the jsp page. Feel free to add your own CSS. The sql scripts to create the database are located in the sqlscripts folder. This version of the app uses the Spring framework HibernateTemplate but this is no longer the preferred method of using hibernate in Spring.
I'll create another branch later that uses the preferred hibernate session method.

The app is deployed on Heroku at: http://amazonspring.herokuapp.com/
